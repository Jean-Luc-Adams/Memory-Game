# Memory Game Project

## Important Notes

* Made as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
* Uses starter code provided by Udacity to assist with HTML, CSS, and shuffle function
* Has the Google font of `Jua` for font styling purposes.
* Uses the `font awesome` toolkit (ver. 5.2) for the icons for the score board and the tiles.

## How to Play

The user will click on the tiles for matching pairs until all 8 pairs are found. Based on many moves you make, your star rating can vary from 1 to 3. There will be a modal that shows the results of the game. 

## My Notes

I will occasionally update this project whenever my skills with JavaScript and CSS animation skills increase. It might seem done for now, but I will always update the game every chance I get!!!
